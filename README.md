## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser

2. No installation or setup required!

### Option 2: Serve with HTTP Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Using Python (most systems have this)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js serve package
npx serve .

# Or using the npm script
npm run serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
